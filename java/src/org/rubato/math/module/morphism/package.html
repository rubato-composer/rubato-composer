    <p>
      This package provides classes implementing morphisms between modules.
    </p>

    <p>
      The provided morphisms are mostly affine morphisms. Included are
      methods for building new morphisms from existing ones, such as the
      difference, the sum, the composition and the power of morphisms.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There are also identity and constant morphisms, as well as
      morphisms translated by an element.
