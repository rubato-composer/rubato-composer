    <p>
      This package provides classes for arithmetic in the domains of 
      complex numbers, rational numbers and modular integers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additionally there are various classes implementing string monoids, where the
      factors may be integers, reals, rationals or modular integers.

      Finally, low-level folding operations are provided by the Folding class.
